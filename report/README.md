A (written) simulation test report, which documents the generated test scenarios, classes, scripting methods, simulation test coverage, and problem findings. Sample structure of the simulation test report (for reference only):
  * Section 1 Introduction
    * Test organization and roles
    * Challenge strategy and planning
    * Targeted simulation resources 
    * Targeted AV simulation test requirments
  * Section 2 AV Simulation Test Scenario Generation
    * Applied strategy
    * Used methods/apporaches
    * Supporting technology and tools
  * Section 3 AV Simulation Test Results
    * Established AV simulation test requirements based on scenarios
    * Focused scenario classes and divesity 
    * Statistics and distribution report about executive scenarios and scripts for different classified scenario types (or classes)
    * Discovered problems and statistics
  * Section 4 Summary and Experience
